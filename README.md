wp-skeleton-cli
===============

A skeleton project for Wordpress, using [WP-CLI](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli) for downloading, installation and configuration.


## Inspiration

The idea for this project came from [Mark Jaquith's Wordpress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton). The structure is the same with wordpress in a `wp` folder and themes, plugins and uploads in `content`, where the uploads is a symlink to a `shared` folder on the same level as `wp` and `content`

## Work in progress

For me this project now works ("on my machine"), but I have already some ideas for improvements:

- [ ] Add a getting started to README.md
- [ ] Include WP-CLI as a phar in a bin dir
